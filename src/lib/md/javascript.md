# JavaScript

---

[`JavaScript`](https://www.javascript.com/) JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development. It's a core technology of the World Wide Web alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages by adding behavior to the static elements of a website.

The compiler itself is written in TypeScript. Its source code is licensed under MIT License and hosted on GitHub.

JavaScript can be used for a variety of purposes, including: :

- Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript code runs on the client's web browser, allowing developers to manipulate the HTML content, handle user interactions, and dynamically update the page without reloading it.
- Server-Side Scripting: With the introduction of platforms like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side scripting, enabling developers to build entire web applications using only JavaScript on both the client and server sides.
- Web Application Development: JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js have gained popularity for building single-page applications (SPAs) and complex web interfaces.
- Mobile App Development: Technologies like React Native and Ionic allow developers to build mobile applications using JavaScript, which can then be deployed to multiple platforms like iOS and Android.
- Game Development: JavaScript, along with HTML5 and WebGL, can be used to create browser-based games and interactive experiences.

## Example

```js
// Prompt the user to enter their name
var name = prompt("What is your name?");

// Check if the user entered a name
if (name) {
    // Display a greeting message
    alert("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to our website.");
} else {
    // If the user didn't enter a name, display a generic greeting
    alert("Hello! Welcome to our website.");
}
```


> JavaScript's versatility, ease of use, and widespread adoption make it a fundamental technology for web development and beyond.
